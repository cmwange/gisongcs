The motivation behind this repository is to outline the steps required to develop a geospatial application using Google Cloud Services (GCS). This is part of my PhD project whereby I am showcasing how trends technology (such as Cloud, Big Data, Linked Data and others) can be used to accelerate development of SDIs.

We are going to use <a href="http://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>, <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker containers</a>, <a href="http://geoserver.org/">GeoServer</a>, a Linux flavour such as <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>, <a href="https://openlayers.org/">OpenLayers</a> and of course a DBMS such as <a href="http://www.postgis.net/">PostGIS</a>
