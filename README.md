The motivation behind this repository is to outline the steps required to develop a geospatial application using Google Cloud Services (GCS). This is part of my PhD project whereby I am showcasing how trends technology (such as Cloud, Big Data, Linked Data and others) can be used to accelerate development of SDIs.

We are going to use Docker containers, Kubernetes, Linux, GeoServer, PostGIS, OpenLayers and other technnologies.
